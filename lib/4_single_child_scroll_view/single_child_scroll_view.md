| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | Unique key for the widget | `key: UniqueKey()` |
| `scrollDirection` | The axis along which the scroll view scrolls | `scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal` |
| `reverse` | Whether the scroll view scrolls in the reading direction. | `reverse: true` |
| `padding` | The amount of space by which to inset the child. | `padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0)` |
| `primary` | Whether this is the primary scroll view associated with the parent | `primary: true` |
| `physics` | How the scroll view should respond to user input | `physics: ClampingScrollPhysics()` |
| `controller` | The ScrollController to use | `controller: _scrollController` |
| `child` | The widget that will be scrolled | `child: Text("Scrolling Text")` |
| `dragStartBehavior` | Determines the way that drag start behavior is handled. | `dragStartBehavior: DragStartBehavior.down` |
| `clipBehavior` | Whether to clip the child. | `clipBehavior: Clip.none` |
| `restorationId` | The restoration ID of the scroll view | `restorationId: 'scroll_view'` |
| `keyboardDismissBehavior` | The way that the keyboard is dismissed when scrolling starts. | `keyboardDismissBehavior: ScrollViewKeyboardDismissBehavior.onDrag` |

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  reverse: true,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  primary: true,
  physics: ClampingScrollPhysics(),
  controller: _scrollController,
  child: Text("Scrolling Text"),
  dragStartBehavior: DragStartBehavior.down,
  clipBehavior: Clip.none,
  restorationId: 'scroll_view',
  keyboardDismissBehavior: ScrollViewKeyboardDismissBehavior.onDrag
),
```
Here,

-   `scrollDirection` is set to `Axis.horizontal` so that the child can be scrolled horizontally.
-   `reverse` is set to `true` so that the scrolling direction is reversed.
-   `padding` is set to `EdgeInsets.all(8.0)` so that there is 8 pixels of padding around the child.
-   `primary` is set to `true` so that this scroll view is the primary scrolling view.
-   `physics` is set to `BouncingScrollPhysics()` which is a custom scroll physics that provides a bouncing effect when the user reaches the edge of the view.
-   `controller` is set to `ScrollController()` which allows you to control the scrolling behavior of the view.
-   `child` is a `Container` with fixed width `300` and green color
-   `dragStartBehavior` is set to `DragStartBehavior.down` which determines the way the drag gesture should start.
-   `clipBehavior` is set to `Clip.none` which means no clipping will be done to the child.
-   `restorationId` is set to "scrollView
